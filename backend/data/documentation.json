    "answer": "If you're not seeing updates from team members, try these steps: refresh the page or app, check that you have permission to view the project, verify the team member has actually saved their changes, ensure you're both on the same project version (check for sync conflicts), and clear your browser cache. Real-time updates require a stable internet connection. If using the mobile app, ensure it's updated to the latest version. Contact support if the issue persists with specific details about what changes aren't appearing.",
